# Bike-share-system-Analysis


We are performing exploratory and explanatory analysis to the data
which is obtained from bike sharing system data to obtain useful visualization to give insights about users


Key insights
We are making Univariate analysis to get the relation between trip duration and frequency to identify the most common trip Durations
identifing the most common category that use bikes is it the subscriber who are regeistered to the system or the customers who are new to the system
Identifing Relation between Clients age and Trips frequency
distribution of trips among the whole year
and distribution of trips among the weekdays

Then we use bivariate analysis to know whether the age of User affect the distance of the trip through the most appropirate visualization

also get the Relation between gender and Trip duration considering other factors

Finally the multivariate analysis to identify the gender who spend more durations 

Main findings


most trips Vary from 1 minute to 50

Subscriber clients have the largest share of using bikeshare Than casual customers

this data belong to only one month (february)

Bike rides decrease in saturday and sunday as they are holiday in most professions

Male have more frequent trips with similar proportion to females and others

Others and females have have greater trip duration than males which might be due to driving slower than Males

Also from this graph we conclude that the trip duration increase in holidays which might be beacause customers go in picnics or driving slowly as there is no need for rush for jobs
